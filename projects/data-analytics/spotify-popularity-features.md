# Spotify Track Popularity Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Spotify track data to explore how track popularity relates to audio characteristics and other measurable attributes. The analysis was completed as the final project for a professional data analytics certification and focuses on descriptive and exploratory analysis rather than predictive modeling.

The goal of the project is to identify patterns and differences in popularity using structured queries and visual analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset contains Spotify track-level data, including popularity scores and audio features provided by Spotify.

**Key characteristics:**
- One record per track
- Numerical audio features
- Popularity score as a numeric indicator of relative popularity

The dataset was reviewed for completeness and basic consistency before analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** - data querying and filtering  
- **Excel** - data cleaning and preparation  
- **Tableau** - exploratory analysis and visualization  

---

## Analytical Approach

### 1. Data Extraction (SQL)
- Queried Spotify track data to select relevant fields
- Filtered records to focus on valid and usable entries
- Structured the output for downstream analysis

SQL was used to define the analytical dataset and ensure a clean starting point.

---

### 2. Data Preparation (Excel)
- Reviewed exported data for inconsistencies
- Cleaned and standardized column values
- Prepared datasets for visualization and analysis in Tableau

Excel was used for lightweight data preparation and validation rather than complex transformations.

---

### 3. Exploratory Analysis & Visualization (Tableau)

Exploratory analysis was conducted in Tableau to examine how popularity varies across different track characteristics.

Analysis included:
- Comparing popularity distributions
- Exploring relationships between popularity and audio features
- Identifying visible trends and contrasts across groups

Visualizations were designed to support interpretation and clear communication of patterns.

---

## Key Findings

- Popularity varies noticeably across tracks with different audio characteristics
- Some features show clearer patterns in relation to popularity than others
- Distributions highlight substantial variability, suggesting multiple contributing factors

Findings are descriptive and observational, based on visual and exploratory analysis.

---

## Limitations

- The analysis is exploratory and does not establish causation
- No predictive or statistical models were applied
- Results depend on the available audio features and popularity metric
- Popularity may be influenced by external factors not captured in the dataset

These limitations were considered when interpreting the results.

## Conclusions

This project demonstrates a practical analytics workflow using SQL, Excel, and Tableau:
- Defining analytical datasets using SQL
- Preparing and validating data in Excel
- Exploring and communicating insights through Tableau visualizations

The project emphasizes clarity, structure, and analytical reasoning in a business-friendly context.
