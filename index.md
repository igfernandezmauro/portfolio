## Data Engineering & Full-Stack Projects

---

### 1. Magic: the Gathering Commander Tracker
**Tools:** AWS Lambda · API Gateway · DynamoDB · S3 · JavaScript · React (UI) · Serverless REST APIs

**Summary:**
Built an autonomous system that syncs deck data from _Archidekt_, stores snapshots and diffs over time, tracks user-logged play events, and serves analytics via REST APIs. The UI allows game logging on mobile, time-zone converted timestamps, and a smart deck picker that balances freshness and randomness.

**Key contributions:**
- Event log design and DynamoDB modeling
- Serverless cloud architecture (Lambda + S3 + DynamoDB)
- API design with stage deployments and CORS
- Frontend UI for asynchronous data updates
- UX considerations for mobile data input

## Data Analytics Projects

---

### 1. Content Performance Analysis with Databricks
**Tools:** Databricks · Spark · Python · Statsmodels · Matplotlib

**Summary:**  
Exploratory and statistical analysis of content performance data using Databricks, focused on understanding which variables are associated with higher view counts. The project combines data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and multiple linear regression (OLS) to evaluate relationships between exposure and engagement metrics.

**Key contributions:**
- Cleaned and prepared structured performance data in Databricks
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand distributions and correlations
- Built and interpreted an OLS regression model using Statsmodels
- Evaluated model fit and statistical significance of explanatory variables
- Interpreted results and limitations from an analytical perspective

## Analytical Approach

Projects in this portfolio follow a consistent analytics workflow:

1. **Understand the dataset and question** - clarify scope, assumptions, and limits  
2. **Prepare the data** - clean, validate, and structure for analysis  
3. **Explore relationships** - apply descriptive analysis or statistical models  
4. **Communicate insights** - present findings clearly using visuals and narrative
